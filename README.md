### TikTok Downloader

## How to use

1. Place this script in a directory with your 'user_data_tiktok.json' file, obtained from [TikTok's Data Download Page](https://www.tiktok.com/setting/download-your-data)
2. Run the script, modify paths only if necessary (eg. saving to a remote location)
3. Wait patiently. Downloads are slow. In fact, you may want to run this in a headless `screen(1)` session so you can walk away for hours.
